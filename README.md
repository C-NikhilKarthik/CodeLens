# Code Analyser and Documentation Generator

## Overview

This project aims to streamline the process of understanding, setting up, and maintaining code repositories. By analyzing the provided repository, our tool generates comprehensive README and setup files, ensuring that even the most neglected repositories are well-documented and easy to use.

## Features

- **Automated Documentation**: Automatically generate detailed README files, complete with installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contributor information.
- **Setup Configuration**: Create setup files that outline the steps needed to get the project up and running, including dependencies and environment configurations.
- **Code Analysis**: Gain insights into the structure and functionality of the codebase, highlighting key components and their interactions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface that guides you through the process of analyzing your code and generating documentation.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Tailor the generated documentation to meet your specific needs, with options for different formats and styles.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Repository**: Provide a link to your GitHub repository or upload the code directly.
2. **Analysis**: The tool scans the codebase to understand its structure, dependencies, and key functionalities.
3. **Documentation Generation**: Based on the analysis, the tool generates a README file and setup instructions, ensuring that all necessary information is included.
4. **Review and Edit**: Review the generated files and make any necessary edits before committing them to your repository.
